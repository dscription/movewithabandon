## Project Inspiration
Having spent most of my professional career as a personal trainer, movement specialist, and visual artist, I have always been fascinated with the human body, and the intersection between creativity, movement, and technology. I want to create experiences that leverage technology to help people move in new ways, to explore the capacity for movement that their bodies have, and to learn about themselves along the way. 

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- p5.js
- ccapture.js
- ml5.js
- Python
- Django
- Postgresql

## User Stories
- AAU, I should be able to create an account
- AAU, I should be able to start a timed experience in the browser that captures my movement and does something creative with my joint positions.
- AAU, I should be able to view my recorded videos.
- AAU, I should be able to share my recorded videos.
- AAU, I should be able to delete my recorded videos.
- AAU, I should be able to make my videos private or publicly share then to the community gallery.

## Stretch Goals:
- Make a multi-user experience with socket.io
- Make a variety of games and experiences for the user to chose from.
- Allow users to like other users videos
- Stream users posts to twitter or allow them to upload to facebook/instagram.
